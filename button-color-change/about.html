    <p>
        This is a simple webpage that demonstrates how to change the 
        color of a button when it is clicked. The button starts with a default color, 
        and when you click on it, the color changes to a different one. 
        This functionality is achieved using JavaScript, which listens for 
        the click event on the button and then updates its style accordingly.

        The purpose of this example is to illustrate how event handling works in web development, 
        and how you can manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) to create interactive elements on a webpage. 
        By changing the color of the button, we can provide visual feedback to the user, making the interface more e
        ngaging and responsive.
